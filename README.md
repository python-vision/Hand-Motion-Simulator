# 🖐 Hand Motion Simulator


## 🚀 Introduction
This project is a **HandMotionSimulator** built using **MediaPipe**. The system detects hand movements in real-time using a webcam and **simulates hand gestures** on-screen. It's a powerful way to interact with virtual environments using just your hand movements.

## 🎯 Features
✅ **Real-time Hand Tracking** using MediaPipe
✅ **Gesture Recognition** for natural interaction
✅ **Smooth Simulation** of hand movement on-screen
✅ **Lightweight & Efficient** (Runs on CPU)

## 🛠️ Installation
To run this project, follow these steps:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/python-vision/Hand-Motion-Simulator.git
cd Hand-Motion-Simulator
```

## ▶️ Usage
Run the following command to start the hand gesture simulator:

```bash
python HandDetector.py
```

Move your hand in front of the camera and watch the simulation in action! 🎥✨

## 🏗️ How It Works
1. **Capture**: The webcam captures hand movements.
2. **Detection**: MediaPipe processes the hand landmarks.
3. **Simulation**: The detected hand is drawn and simulated on the screen.

### 🔧 Tech Stack
- **Python** 🐍
- **MediaPipe** 🤖
- **OpenCV** 📷
- **NumPy** 🔢

## 📌 To-Do List
- [ ] Add more gesture recognition
- [ ] Improve accuracy of hand detection
- [ ] Implement interaction with virtual objects
